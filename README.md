## 🔄 Data Preparation & Cleaning
Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed using Python to ensure data quality and consistency:
Handling missing values
Removing duplicate records
Standardizing inconsistent formats
Validating numerical fields (prices, quantities)
Preparing structured datasets for BI analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using Matplotlib and Seaborn to validate trends and detect anomalies before importing the data into Power BI.
